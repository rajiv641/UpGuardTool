# The configuration file contains three parameters, as in this example:
# The keys can be retrieved from the Upguard site, in the main account page (/accounts/NNN)
# The default name for the config file ugtool looks for is `.upguard`
# Useful naming convention: rename this example file ../.upguard-1234567 where 1234567 is the account number
